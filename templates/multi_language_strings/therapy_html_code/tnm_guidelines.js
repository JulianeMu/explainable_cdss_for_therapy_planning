    return "<h1>Laryngeal Cancer Stages</h1><p>The earliest stage of laryngeal cancer is stage 0, also known as <strong>carcinoma in situ</strong><em> </em>(CIS). The other main stages range from I (1) through IV (4). Some stages are split further, using capital letters (A, B, etc.).  As a rule, the lower the number, the less the cancer has spread. A higher number, such as stage IV, means cancer has spread more. And within a stage, an earlier letter means a lower stage. Although each personâ€™s cancer experience is unique, cancers with similar stages tend to have a similar outlook and are often treated in much the same way.</p> \n" +
        "   <h2>How is the stage determined?</h2> \n" +
        "   <p>The staging system most often used for laryngeal cancer is the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) <strong>TNM</strong> system, which is based on 3 key pieces of information:</p> \n" +
        "   <ul> \n" +
        "    <li>The extent of the main<strong> tumor (T):</strong> Where is the tumor? How far has it grown into the larynx and nearby structures? Has it affected vocal cord movement?</li> \n" +
        "    <li>The spread to nearby lymph <strong>nodes (N):</strong> Has the cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes in the neck? If so, how many are affected, and how large are they?</li> \n" +
        "    <li>The spread (<strong>metastasis</strong>) to distant sites <strong>(M):</strong> Has the cancer spread to distant parts of the body? (The most common sites of spread are the lungs, liver, or bones.)</li> \n" +
        "   </ul> \n" +
        "   <p>Numbers or letters after T, N, and M provide more details about each of these factors. Higher numbers mean the cancer is more advanced. </p> \n" +
        "   <p>Once the T, N, and M categories of the cancer have been determined, this information is combined in a process called <strong>stage grouping</strong> to assign an overall stage. For more information, see <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/treatment/understanding-your-diagnosis/staging.html\">Cancer Staging</a>.</p> \n" +
        "   <p>The system described below is the most recent AJCC system, effective January 2018. </p> \n" +
        "   <p>Laryngeal cancer is typically given a <strong>clinical stage</strong> based on the results of any exams, biopsies, and imaging tests that might have been done (as described in <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/laryngeal-and-hypopharyngeal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/how-diagnosed.html\">How Are Laryngeal and Hypopharyngeal Cancers Diagnosed?</a>). If surgery has been done, the <strong>pathologic stage</strong> (also called the <em>surgical stage</em>) can be determined.</p> \n" +
        "   <p>The stages of laryngeal cancer are slightly different, based on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/laryngeal-and-hypopharyngeal-cancer/about/what-is-laryngealand-hypopharyngeal.html\">which part of the larynx</a>\n" +
        "      the cancer starts in:</p> \n" +
        "   <ul> \n" +
        "    <li>The <strong>supraglottis</strong> (the area above the vocal cords)</li> \n" +
        "    <li>The <strong>glottis</strong> (the area that includes the vocal cords)</li> \n" +
        "    <li>The <strong>subglottis</strong> (the area below the vocal cords)</li> \n" +
        "   </ul> \n" +
        "   <p>Laryngeal cancer staging can be complex, so ask your doctor to explain it to you in a way you understand.</p> \n" +
